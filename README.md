# A functioning EXAMPLE project written in P5.Js on how to create a code that randomly generates letters on  keyboard 
# that correspond to online keyboard piano keys.

This project is my first in coding in p5.Js, and I have created a code that displays a play along series of randomly
generated letters and numbers. This code is designed to be used with an online keyboard piano, as it randomly generates 
letters and numbers for user to play along with. The project is a sample code in it's starting form but should work to do the 
following :

* Generate a yellow screen, with mutlicoloured letters and numbers appearing in the center.
* Generate completely random series of numbers and letters that is unique every time.
* The word "play along!" should appear in black at the bottom of the canvas.
